# INFO: Be sure to always keep the domain of the problem in mind! It's
# WAY more important to errantly classify a benign tumor as malignant,
# and have it removed, than to incorrectly leave a malignant tumor, believing
# it to be benign, and then having the patient progress in cancer. Since the UDF
# weights don't give you any class information, the only way to introduce this
# data into SKLearn's KNN Classifier is by "baking" it into your data. For
# example, randomly reducing the ratio of benign samples compared to malignant
# samples from the training set.
