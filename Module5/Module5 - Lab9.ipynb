When you use `.fit()`, `.score()`, and `.predict()` on your model, SciKit-Learn expects your training data to be in spreadsheet (2D Array-Like) form. This means you can't simply pass in a 1D Array (slice) and get away with it.\n",

    "To properly prep your data, you have to pass in a 2D Numpy Array, or a dataframe. But what happens if you really only want to pass in a single feature?\n",

    "If you slice your dataframe using `df[['ColumnName']]` syntax, the result that comes back is actually a _dataframe_. Go ahead and do a `type()` on it to check it out. Since it's already a dataframe, you're good -- no further changes needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "But if you slice your dataframe using the `df.ColumnName` syntax, OR if you call `df['ColumnName']`, the result that comes back is actually a series (1D Array)! This will cause SKLearn to bug out. So if you are slicing using either of those two techniques, before sending your training or testing data to `.fit` / `.score`, do `any_column = my_column.reshape(-1,1)`. \n",

    "If you did something like `my_column = [my_column]`, that would produce an array in the shape of `[1, n_samples]`, which is incorrect because SKLearn expects your data to be arranged as `[n_samples, n_features]`. Keep in mind, all of the above only relates to your `X` or input data, and does not apply to your `y` or labels."

Do the scalers that work on a per-feature basis, such as `MinMaxScaler` behave differently that those that work on a multi-feature basis, such as normalize? And moreover, once your features have been scaled, you won't be able to use the resulting regression directly... unless you're able to `.inverse_transform()` the scaling. Do all of the SciKit-Learn scalers support that?\n",
