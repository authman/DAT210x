# INFO + HINT On Fitting, Scoring, and Predicting:
#
# Here's a hint to help you complete the assignment without pulling
# your hair out! When you use .fit(), .score(), and .predict() on
# your model, SciKit-Learn expects your training data to be in
# spreadsheet (2D Array-Like) form. This means you can't simply
# pass in a 1D Array (slice) and get away with it.
#
# To properly prep your data, you have to pass in a 2D Numpy Array,
# or a dataframe. But what happens if you really only want to pass
# in a single feature?
#
# If you slice your dataframe using df[['ColumnName']] syntax, the
# result that comes back is actually a *dataframe*. Go ahead and do
# a type() on it to check it out. Since it's already a dataframe,
# you're good -- no further changes needed.
#
# But if you slice your dataframe using the df.ColumnName syntax,
# OR if you call df['ColumnName'], the result that comes back is
# actually a series (1D Array)! This will cause SKLearn to bug out.
# So if you are slicing using either of those two techniques, before
# sending your training or testing data to .fit / .score, do a
# my_column = my_column.reshape(-1,1). This will convert your 1D
# array of [n_samples], to a 2D array shaped like [n_samples, 1].
# A single feature, with many samples.
#
# If you did something like my_column = [my_column], that would produce
# an array in the shape of [1, n_samples], which is incorrect because
# SKLearn expects your data to be arranged as [n_samples, n_features].
# Keep in mind, all of the above only relates to your "X" or input
# data, and does not apply to your "y" or labels.
