# python list. You can call it 'samples'.

# TODO: Write a for-loop that iterates over the images in the
# Module4/Datasets/ALOI/32/ folder, appending each of them to
# your list. Each .PNG image should first be loaded into a
# temporary NDArray, just as shown in the Feature
# Representation reading.
#
# Optional: Resample the image down by a factor of two if you
# have a slower computer. You can also convert the image from
# 0-255  to  0.0-1.0  if you'd like, but that will have no
# effect on the algorithm's results.

# TODO: Once you're done answering the first three questions,
# right before you converted your list to a dataframe, add in
# additional code which also appends to your list the images
# in the Module4/Datasets/ALOI/32_i directory. Re-run your
# assignment and answer the final question below.
