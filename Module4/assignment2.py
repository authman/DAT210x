# section: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Chronic_Kidney_Disease

# properly detect and convert them to that data type for you, then use

# on your dataset.

# the data will result in a NumPy NDArray. You can either use MatPlotLib
# to graph it directly, or you can convert it to DataFrame and have pandas
# do it for you.

# Since we've already demonstrated how to plot directly with MatPlotLib in
# Module4/assignment1.py, this time we'll convert to a Pandas Dataframe.
#
# Since we transformed via PCA, we no longer have column names. We know we
# are in P.C. space, so we'll just define the coordinates accordingly:
