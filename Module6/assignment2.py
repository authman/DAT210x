# TODO: Once you're able to beat the +98% accuracy score of the
# USPS, go back into the load() method. Look for the line that
# reads "# Special:"
#
# Immediately under that line, alter X_train and y_train ONLY.
# Keep just the ___FIRST___ 4% of the samples. In other words,
# for every 100 samples found, throw away 96 of them. Make sure
# all the samples (and labels) you keep come from the start of
# X_train and y_train.

# If the first 4% is a decimal number, then use int + ceil to
# round up to the nearest whole integer.

# That operation might require some Pandas indexing skills, or
# perhaps some numpy indexing skills if you'd like to go that
# route. Feel free to ask on the class forum if you want; but
# try to exercise your own muscles first, for at least 30
# minutes, by reviewing the Pandas documentation and stack
# overflow. Through that, in the process, you'll pick up a lot.
# Part of being a machine learning practitioner is know what
# questions to ask and where to ask them, so this is a great
# time to start!

# Re-Run your application after throwing away 96% your training
# data. What accuracy score do you get now?




#
# TODO: Lastly, change your kernel back to linear and run your
# assignment one last time. What's the accuracy score this time?
# Surprised?
